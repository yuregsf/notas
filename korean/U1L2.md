# 있다: To have

있다 = to have

있다 = to be at a location

있다 is an adjective, so cannot act on an object.

나는 펜을 있다 = I have a pen; Is incorrect, because 있다 cannot act on 펜, therefore, the use of ~을 is incorrect. To get around, we can attach ~이/가 to the object. So our sentence will be like this: 

나는 펜이 있다

# Indicating a Place or Time: ~에

Particle that denotes a place or time. In English it will be similar to: 

- I am __at__ school
- I ate breakfast __at__ 10:00

# 있다: To be at a location

있다 can also be used to indicate that something/someone is “at a location.”

나는 학교에 있다 = I am at school

We can also use position words to indicate specifically where someone/something is with respect to another noun. The most common position words are:

- 안 = inside
- 위 = on top
- 밑 = below
- 옆 = beside
- 뒤 = behind
- 앞 = in front

학교 앞에 = in front of the school

# ~이/가 as a Subject Marker

~이/가 can be used to mark the subject, like ~는/은. However, when ~는/은 is used, we are comparing the subject with something from a previous context, while ~이/가 is stating a fact.
